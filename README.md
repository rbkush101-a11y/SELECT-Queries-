# SELECT-Queries-
Task 3: Writing Basic SELECT Queries (Library Management)


## Objective
Practice extracting data using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT`.

## Tools
- MySQL Workbench / DB Browser for SQLite
- VS Code for managing scripts

## Files
- `schema.sql` → Table creation
- `insert_data.sql` → Sample data
- `select_queries.sql` → Practice queries
- `screenshots/` → Results screenshots (optional)

## Queries Covered
1. `SELECT *` → All columns  
2. Specific columns → Projection  
3. Filtering with `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`  
4. Pattern search with `LIKE`  
5. Range filtering with `BETWEEN`  
6. Sorting with `ORDER BY ASC/DESC`  
7. Limiting results with `LIMIT`  
8. Removing duplicates with `DISTINCT`  
9. Aliasing columns with `AS`  

## Interview Questions
1. **What does SELECT * do?** → Fetches all columns.  
2. **How do you filter rows?** → Using `WHERE` condition.  
3. **What is LIKE '%value%'?** → Pattern search for values.  
4. **What is BETWEEN used for?** → Selects values in a range.  
5. **How do you limit output rows?** → Using `LIMIT`.  
6. **Difference between = and IN?** → `=` checks one value, `IN` checks multiple.  
7. **How to sort in descending order?** → `ORDER BY column DESC`.  
8. **What is aliasing?** → Renaming column/table temporarily with `AS`.  
9. **Explain DISTINCT.** → Removes duplicate values.  
10. **What is the default sort order?** → Ascending (ASC).
